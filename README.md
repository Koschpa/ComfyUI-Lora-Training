# Info

A fork from https://github.com/LarryJane491/Lora-Training-in-Comfy.

I had a lots of problems, to get the original code to work.     
I just replaced the latest sd-script folder from koyha into this node and refactored the code a little bit.     
Also added the possibility to save training state and resume training from them.        

In future i will remove every unused files and code and will try to make a clean and easy to install ComfyUI node.

# Things i want to fix:
- Installation with venv
- Cancelation of training
- previews during learning
- more parameters to change. maybe a ultra node for people who want to change everything
